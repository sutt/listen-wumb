Overall ideas:

    be able to listen to WUMB curated songs easily...

    use youtube to listen to the tracks
        - search and match 
            - (from ...) is the hard part
        - use embedded player to play continuously

    report which songs were found and misses:
        - I wonder if the videos info will have the

    enter in a time plus date 
        - also allow shows e.g. Holly Harris 6-9pm Saturday

    liking and storing:
        - personal likes / dislikes
        - bookmarks...go to a particular route to "save" time of the song
        - backend that stores parsed playlists + associated youtube addresses

    downloading
        - use youtube-dl to download the songs
        - use youtube-dl to save the songs to cloud
        - use ffmpeg to extract audio only

    other platfroms:
        - spotify?
        - associated websites:
            - beale street caravan
