Overall ideas:

    be able to listen to WUMB curated songs easily...

    use youtube to listen to the tracks
        - search and match 
            - (from ...) is the hard part
        - use embedded player to play continuously

    report which songs were found and misses:
        - I wonder if the videos info will have the

    enter in a time plus date 
        - also allow shows e.g. Holly Harris 6-9pm Saturday

    liking and storing:
        - personal likes / dislikes
        - bookmarks...go to a particular route to "save" time of the song
        - backend that stores parsed playlists + associated youtube addresses

    downloading
        - use youtube-dl to download the songs
        - use youtube-dl to save the songs to cloud
        - use ffmpeg to extract audio only

    other platfroms:
        - spotify?
        - associated websites:
            - beale street caravan

    [ ] should have chromecast option

    [ ] prevent trying to play nonEmbeddable videos
        [ ] test this on canned heat example to see if it works

    [ ] Build a dummy user signed-in/out for frontend behavior
        [ ] signed out user sees the cached blocks as choices
        [ ] signed user sees calendar selection

    [x] deploy + test new features
        [x] proxy-2
        [x] front-end

    [ ] build a client to pull and cache blocks of songs 
        - without going thru frontend itself

    [ ] allow frontend to play new songs (after first five)
        [ ] but this also requires changing the 

    [ ] add api rate limiting on proxy-2
        no more than 5 requests in 10 seconds (without override)

7.1

    [x] refactor with controllers
        
    [ ] minor imporvements
        [ ] checking status code in searchItem
        [ ] adding videoEmbeddable
        [ ] check for requestResponseValid=true in query

    [x] Build a cached-block frontend and have that apply to 

        [x] request query params choses the variables on playlist load:
            ?time=1:14pm&date=5-22-21            

            [x] add in a url fork option
                this is in blocks-script.js
                just check the page's / window's urlbar
                window.location.href

            [x] move index.html into views

            [x] move the decodeQuery function into utils
            
            [x] test it
        
        [x] add a frontend page
            [x] display blocks in a crude style
            [x] these blocks make requests to main page with params


7.1
    
    [ ] why is there a different size in the same requests (in Network tab)?
        - the initial request is 100x larger
        - 16,000 bytes vs 240 bytes
        - but they appear the same length ?
        - must be compression or encoding ?
        [ ] check the response code
    
    [ ] weird deploy issue on cors

        Access to fetch at 'https://wumb-proxy-2.herokuapp.com/parse?live=true&d=210522' 
        from origin 'https://wumb-front-v1.herokuapp.com' 
        has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header 
        is present on the requested resource. 
        If an opaque response serves your needs, 
        set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

    [ ] long wait time for updating playlist ...(3-5 seconds for parse to return)
        - investigate why?
        - maybe it's because limited incoming/outgoing bandwith on heroku server?
        [ ] compared against page load time on browser
        [ ] time it server side
            

    [x] investigate secondary info from api we can add:

        info on api params:
        https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list?apix_params=%7B%22part%22%3A%22snippet%22%2C%22order%22%3A%22viewCount%22%2C%22q%22%3A%22skateboarding%20dog%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22video%22%2C%22videoDefinition%22%3A%22high%22%7D

            videoEmbeddable: true

                "If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video."

        https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos

            [x] how much does this resource cost in quota?
                -> 1 point
            [x] does multiple videoIds cost more?
                -> apparently not

                all quotas
                https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?service=youtube.googleapis.com&project=listen-wumb

                [x] figure out how long it takes for quota to be visible?
                    -> ~10 minutes
                    [x] wait for a plateau
                    [x] send one request, wait for it to apply to quota
                [x] then test a request with 1 vs 3 ids


            https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?

                &key=[YOUR_API_KEY]

                - there are three video id's

                - part=suggestions doesnt appear to work (?)



    [x] move print functions into utils/, fix its references
            
    [ ] get mock db setup
        - this will use mock videos to connect with actual song-titles
        - this can preserve the real database to have the correct songs
        [ ] how to switch the behavior between the two modes? 
            -environmental var?

    [x] commit and deploy cache
        [x] add in an atlasdb cluster
            -> 
            Org: listen-wumb
            Project: wumb1
            Cluster: Cluster0
            DB:   wumbBackend1

            type: M0 Sandbox max 512 MB 
                -> 3,500 - 15,000 total tracks

        [x] link to proxy-2 server
            [x] check local printouts for sparsity
            [x] deploy
            [x] test manually without seeds
            [x] check heroku logs for printouts
            [x] delete + re-seed using utils
                > heroku run  cd db/crud-utils; node insert-seeds.js --app wumb-proxy-2
            

    [~] add a testDb vs productionDb


    [x] add a route for cached songs:
        
        [x] add a new controller:
            [x] test route
            
        [x] design the api:
            - REST style?
            
                index route: basics
                details route: 
                    gaps of 10 minutes 

        [x] list the needed params:
            - total number of songs
            - min/max times each day
            - number of songs per day

        [x] do some basic queries in demo-client
            [x] find good documentation for this
        
        [x] getTime() from the Date object to an EST time
        
        
        - queries to build "blocks of time"
            a block consist of a date and startTime + endTime
            blocks = [
                {date: '5-13-21',
                 startTime: "7:13 pm",
                 endTime: "8:22 pm",
                 numSongs: 22,
                 },

                 }
            ]

    to move to a frontenv-v2, need to:
        - factor out util functions into a utils.js
            - how to import export?
            -> then use this to drop into a front-v2 react app
        - develop a js strategy for inserting info from the route?

"The Two fetches":

    Plan of Attack:
     - get proxy-2 setup, and into the pipeline
     - get this express <-> script.js figured out
     - then move the searching functionality to server-sdie
     - from there start building out search caching 

     [x] standup proxy-2 on new port
     [~] how to switch proxy-2 as enpoint on?
        - command line arg?
     [~] research + prototype express <-> js
     [x] move search server side
        [x] hbs variables attached to params and used server side
            - since frontend js is based on route
        [x] fetch -> node-fetch

    [x] test the local site dead+alive
        [x] how to control TestingSwitches from frontend?
            - look in to how scrape did ?live
            - when proxy2-serverside code needs to determine url for search endpoint
            [x] why is key not loading? -> need .dotenv package
            [x] not getting ?live param stuck on
                [x] cp script.js
                [x] why does Aimee Mann keep getting stuck on site-mock?
                    
                    -> escape characters:
                        
                        actual: Aimee Mann	True Believer (from @#%&*! Smilers)
                        encoded: &artist=Aimee%20Mann&title=True%20Believer%20(from%20@

                        [ ] what is the character preventing this ?
        

    [x] deploy proxy-2
        [x] delete existing app
        [x] get current deploy frontend to match
    
    [x] Test Deployment
        [~] get a new api token
        [x] Test Dead
        [x] Test Each Alive?
    
    [x] On deployyment, bug: parse?live=true as default
        [x] is this seen on local as well?
            -> not on parse
        [x] verify on deploy
            -> false alarm

    [x] deploy version still making search requests to mock-site (instead of proxy-2)
        [x] verify on local -> correct there
        [x] fix and deploy
            [x] how to verify if deploy went through?
        [x] new error - cors

    [x] autoplay working
        -> its tough, lookas like there's it depends if user brings focus to the webpage, it will autoplay otherwise notfocus

    [x] frontend improvements
        [x] fix async load out-of-order `vids` bug
        [x] player autoplay -> must bring to focus to page within 2 secs of load
        [x] date + time logic

    [x] make site-mock better
        [x] get actual songs on site mock
            looks like we just put stuff in yt-mock-data
                [x] put the api client in the mock directory
                [x] add api key
                [x] fire it
                [x] get it to write to a file

        [x] more pages on page
            [x] move html file into a directory
            [x] add query param check
            [x] add the query logic to front

        [x] control which page via ?d=21065 parameter

        

    [x] adding the date/time logic
        [x] what forms of string dates work for js?
        [x] figure out the mapping "actual" Date() <-> wumb's ?d=1234
            -> YYMMDD
        [x] add js functionality frontend
            [x] how to catch new Date() errors for validation?
        [x] test it works from front end
        [x] add d= parameter on proxy-2
        test:
        [x] date logic works with proxy for different pages
        [x] date logic works live

    
    [x] deploy + test new logic

        [x] locally: test scrape-dead + scrape-live
            using slug /pagelive

        [x] locally: test search-live 
            [x] test how well it does -> pretty good!
        
        [x] make it 1:10 for the frontend default

        [x] site-mock
        [x] frontend
        [x] proxy2

        [x] frontend bug:
            script.js 146 - setHighlighClass() breaks execution before new playlist loads
            [x] what lines fail? hypothesis holds?
                -> note: 6/2/21 has a page with no songs listed
            [x] replicate locally
                  -> not a perfect replication because we don't recover on deployed app, whereas we do locally
            [x] add try / catch
            [x] push remotely

        [x] deplyed: test wumb-dead + wumb-live 
            [x] how do you control it from the frontend?
                -> via slug

        
    [x] time function to get a subset of songs
            [x] implement first five songs after time specified
            [x] allow form submission to control
            [x] get it to overwrite existing html playlist
        [x] show that you can grabbed different blocks of songs

    [ ] frontend bug: 
        clicking songs outof order doesn't hide the previously highlighted song row
        also occurs when doing "<< prev" button

    [ ] frontend logic: song not externally playable, 
        should skip songs / seek different videoid item in the results
        error message:
            Video unavailable
            Playback on other websites has been disabled by the video owner.
            -> occurs on "canned heat, on the road again"
        [ ] frontend logic to check for status
        [ ] check results json for the indicator

    [ ] frontend bug: player loses ability to do "Next Song" on playlist refresh

    [ ] frontend bug: alert when no playlist items found    
        - informative: are there songs at the time before it?
                        or are there no songs for that day
                        print out existing input time and wumb link

    [ ] frontend bug: if the 0th song never returns api results we should play the 1th, etc,
        as it stands the user will have to click next

    [ ] frontend bug: new playlist load causes pink select of 1th new song but loads 0th new song,
                        then "next >>" skips the 1th song

    [ ] frontend logic: skip songs without a clear artist and title
        e.g. artist: "", title: "SON18-99"

    [ ] frontend logic: 
        - show a loading element while scrape loads
        - show a message on what playlist is loading by default

    [ ] need better refresh playlist logic
        - just calling scrapeArchive() in timeForm is duplicating a lot of DOM creation
        - we want to preserve the currently playing playlist before accepting the new one
        - what about global variables like:
            playlist?

    [x] prototype the search cache
        [x] check that new function returns the same thing
            [x] on dead

        [ ] better way to handle insertion to js from express
        [ ] we can cache scrapes as well
        [ ] why doesn't intellisense work well in express workspaces?

        [ ] url bar should contain params to share the playlist with others
        [ ] if playedDuration > listed duration -> skip rest of song
        [ ] need better landing page logic: what will happen automatically on load?
            - will a default playlist load up?
            - show the already searched time blocks?
        [ ] just show the tile image instead of the player itself
        [ ] add video description as optional 
            - also add in getDuration() result from player
        [ ] show user yt quota on page

    How to Solve the quota limit:
        - use the user quota instead of the non-logged in version?
            - investigate by doc:

        - use bing search api
            - looks promising
            - $7 / 1,000 requests

        - spotify api

        - use an economical approach to yt-search with:
            - previous search cache-ing, "memo-ization"-stratgey
            - user log-in to be able to search new blocks
                - move yt-search server-side
            - can have a microservice serverside, to check my api quota and display it clientside
                - this is because we want the cloud console key to be hidden
